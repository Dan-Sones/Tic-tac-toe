<h2>How it works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User is asked what position (1-9) they would like to place there cross</li>
  <li>A random postion is generated by the "CPU"</li>
  <li>This number is then run through a method that ensures the position is not already taken by a Nought or cross</li>
  <li>If it is taken go back to step 2</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 1-3 untill a diagonal, collumn or row of three is made of either Nouhghts or Crosses</li>
  <li>Print If it is a draw, win for the user or loss for the user</li>
</ol>
